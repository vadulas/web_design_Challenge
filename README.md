The purpose of this project was to analyze the weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from teh OPenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities

After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlisb to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity.This slite provides teh cource data and Visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptios of any trends and correlations witnessed.
